## Voting for repo maintainers and new members
Question about the state of the squads.  What are they thinking and what are their desires?

Ask the standup leaders to ask the squads and send a list of the observations and requests as part of their standup?

## Release Process
Versioning ... 1st is version, 2nd is features and third is patches
Question about how will tools use the versioning.  Specifically, SMP/e in how it installs.  SMP/e tends to ignore the third level and how do we manage version levels.

Should we omit the third level.

## ZenHub
Vote approved to move to ZenHub from Waffle.
